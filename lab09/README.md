#Lab 09

##Description 
This is the git branch for lab09 for Stats 159 called "LaTex".

##Goal
Our goal is to re-write the report for *HW2 - SImple Regression Analysis* using Rmw file format and convert it into a LaTex document.
I have rewritten the homework 2 and produce a similar pdf using Rmw file format.


##File Structure  
The files in this branch will contain "lab09.Rnw" which is the R code, the LaTeX generated document called "lab09.pdf", the image file "histogram-tv-sales.png" and the RData file called "regression.RData".  
There are also other files produce by compiling the PDF. 

##Steps to reproduce:  
To reproduce, simply fork or download the contents. Then, run the lab09.Rnw file in Rstudio and click "Compile PDF" on the top center.
