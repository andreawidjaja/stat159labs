#Lab 08

##Description 
This is the git branch for lab8 for Stats 159 called "ShinyDocs".

##Goal
Learn how to build an interactive webpage using R and ShinyDocs from Homework 2.  
I have created a shiny web app that allows users to view different scatterplot of Advertising medias, chosen from a dropdown menu.

##File Structure  
The files in this branch will contain "Advertising.csv" and the shiny app called "app.R".

##Steps to reproduce:  
To reproduce, simply fork or download the contents. Then, run the app.R file in Rstudio and click "Run App" on the top right corner.
